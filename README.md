# Counter
Simple Counter
First JavaScript project for the Strat2Impact University master's program. It's a simple increment and decrement counter. I developed the project as requested by the coaches, implementing the increment, decrement, and reset buttons directly with JavaScript. To make things more fun (for me), I decided to place these buttons inside the cart of a fictional e-commerce website. I hope you like it!
