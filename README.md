# Counter
---Simple Counter---

[PROJECT LINK] (https://julysway.github.io/Counter/)

First ***JavaScript project for the Strat2Impact University*** master's program. It's a simple increment and decrement counter. I developed the project as requested by the coaches, implementing the increment, decrement, and reset buttons directly with JavaScript. To make things more fun (for me), I decided to place these buttons inside the cart of a fake e-commerce website. I hope you like it!
